# Daily_Weather_Forecast

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with using APIs and the manipulation of said APIs. If you input a city name into the field you will get the current weather for that city and the next 5 days forecast. This was a very challenging assignment due to having how to use bootstrap along side jquery. I am now way more familiar with all these tools.
